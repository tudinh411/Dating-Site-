### Web Programming Step by Step
## Assignment: NerdLuv
### Description
This assignment is about processing HTML forms with PHP.

Online dating has become mainstream with popular sites such as eHarmony, match.com, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish. Your task for this assignment is to write HTML and PHP code for a fictional online dating site for desperate single geeks, called NerdLuv.com. The site will consist of two pages: a front page called index.php (skeleton provided to you) that contains a form for a user to submit information, and a result page called results.php (that you will write entirely) that displays single people who match with the applicant.

Turn in the following files:

* **index.php**, the front signup page (skeleton provided)
* **results.php**, the results page (no starter code provided; write this yourself)
* **nerdluv.css**, the CSS style sheet for both pages (skeleton provided)
* **common.php**, a file containing any code you want to share between pages (optional)
